## Description: 
This program will help character designers with a creative block, to assemble a character with random attributes. It can be used for those who want practice drawing for different prompts/descriptions or for anyone wanting to broaden their creative scope in the characters they design.

## Features: 
The user will be able to opt to pick different sections of the prompt not to be randomized (If they wanted it to be a girl, human, and not have that part be random, they can type in that for that section and that will be in the output print with the rest of the randomized details). I plan on doing this with an if then type statement.

Alt/additional: Two personality traits output (Or the user gets to pick how many traits are output IE: the user can have a very jumbled personality if they choose to output 5 different traits…having to include a lot of interesting detail in their characters). I plan on doing this with an if then type statement.


##Challenges:
I will have to learn how to make the randomize feature optional…and if the optional option is chosen, I will need to also learn how to prompt the user to then type in what their chosen base is. 

## Outcomes: 
    a. Ideal Outcome - The outcome hope is to help artists with their character design efforts by giving them a detailed, but randomized prompt, to inspire or help describe a new character for design. Ideally, I would like for the user to be able to choose whether they want the randomized prompt for each section, prompting them to type in their own choice if they do not want the art prompt.

    b. Minimal Viable Outcome - The minimal outcome I would hope to achieve is to give the user a detailed character design prompt, but not allow them to choose between the prompt and their own choice. If even that doesn’t work, at the very least, I would want to have the generator give one piece of information to the user to make their already existing character more unique, rather than describing the whole thing.

## Milestones:
    1. Create a simple gender prompt for the character…and/or human versus animal and what kind of animal. Create code that outputs personality traits for said character.

    2. Create an output of a clothing style or unique accessory that this character has

    3. Implement a feature that allows the user to pick between the randomized prompt and type in what they would like the prompt to add to.
